# Full Stack Casting Agency API

## Project Content
This is the project is the Udacity capstone project. Dealing with a casting agency with RBAC authentication API design.
Cover topics inclue
1. Database design with ```postgres``` and ```sqlalchemy```
2. API design using ```Flask``` framework
3. Test script design
4. Authentication for roles via ```Auth0```
5. Deployment on ```Heroku```

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup

Before flushing the data into the database, we need to create the database named 'casting_agent' via:
```bash
createdb casting_agent
```
You can try to construct a psql file to flush data in to the database.
In this project, I initialize the data by drop_and_create_all function in model.py file.
## Running the server

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `app.py` directs flask to use the `app.py` file to find the application. 


## API Documentation
You can run it locally with flask run just like descibe above.
Or can get the data from deplied heroku app.
To utilize curl and heroku app with authentication, 
```
TOKEN=<bearer token>
```
You can find the token in config.py file.

4. Create API by clicking API Tab.
5. Enable RBAC in the API.
6. Create new Role.
7. Create and assign permissions.

## Testing
To run the tests, run

python test_app.py
```

Sample
```
.........................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 25 tests in 9.642s

OK
